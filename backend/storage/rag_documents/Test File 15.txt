Music can trigger chills because of prediction and surprise. When you get goosebumps during a song, it’s not just “emotion” in a vague sense. Your brain constantly predicts what will happen next in music—melody, rhythm, harmony. When a song delays a resolution, hits an unexpected chord, or swells into a payoff your brain was waiting for, the reward system can spike dopamine. That physiological rush shows up as chills, a racing heart, or tingling skin. It’s a neat example of how pleasure often comes from a mix of expectation and surprise.
