The Eiffel Tower grows in summer. Iron expands when it heats up, and because the Eiffel Tower is made of wrought iron, it can get noticeably taller in warm weather. On a hot day, the tower can be around 10–15 centimeters higher than in winter. The change is slow and harmless, just the metal stretching slightly as temperatures rise. Engineers account for this kind of thermal expansion in large structures all over the world—bridges, rails, skyscrapers—so they don’t buckle or crack as the seasons change.
