The “smell of rain” has a real name and a real source. That earthy, fresh scent after a dry spell is called petrichor. It comes mainly from oils and organic compounds released by plants and soil. When raindrops hit dry ground, they trap tiny air bubbles that burst and fling microscopic particles upward—basically aerosolizing those compounds so your nose can catch them. A bacterium in soil, Streptomyces, contributes too by producing geosmin, a chemical humans detect at incredibly low concentrations. So that rain smell is a mix of plant chemistry, soil bacteria, and splash physics all working together.
