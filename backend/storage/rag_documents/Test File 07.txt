A day on Venus is longer than its year. Venus rotates extremely slowly: one full spin on its axis takes about 243 Earth days. But Venus orbits the Sun faster than that—roughly 225 Earth days per trip around. So if you stood on Venus (ignoring the crushing pressure and heat), the Sun would rise, crawl across the sky, and set over a span longer than the time it takes Venus to complete an entire orbit. Even weirder, Venus spins backward compared to most planets, so the Sun would appear to rise in the west and set in the east.
