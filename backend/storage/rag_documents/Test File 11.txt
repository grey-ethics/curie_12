Sharks are older than trees. The earliest shark-like fish appeared more than 400 million years ago, long before dinosaurs. The first true trees didn’t show up until later, around 350 million years ago. That means sharks were already cruising ancient seas when land was still mostly covered in simple plants and early forests hadn’t formed yet. Their body plan has been refined but not fundamentally reinvented, which is why people call them “living fossils.” They’ve survived multiple mass extinctions by being extremely adaptable predators.
