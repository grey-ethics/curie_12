Octopuses have three hearts and blue blood. Two of their hearts pump blood to the gills, where it picks up oxygen, and the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Their blood is blue because it uses copper-based hemocyanin to carry oxygen rather than iron-based hemoglobin like humans. Hemocyanin works better in cold, low-oxygen water, which fits the octopus lifestyle. When an octopus swims, the heart that supplies the body actually stops beating, which is why they prefer crawling—swimming is tiring for them.
