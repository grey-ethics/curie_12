Honey never really spoils. Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that were still edible after thousands of years. Honey lasts because it’s extremely low in water, highly acidic, and packed with natural hydrogen peroxide and other antimicrobial compounds. Those conditions make it hard for bacteria or fungi to grow. If honey crystallizes or thickens, that’s not spoilage—it’s just sugar forming crystals. Warming it gently returns it to liquid form, and it’s still safe to eat.
