A “sip” of seawater is mostly a sip of microbes. Ocean water looks clear, but a single milliliter can contain hundreds of thousands to millions of microorganisms—bacteria, tiny algae, and viruses. These microbes form the base of marine food webs and drive huge parts of Earth’s chemistry, including producing a lot of the oxygen you breathe through photosynthesis by microscopic plankton. Viruses in the ocean also help regulate populations by infecting microbes, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. So the ocean isn’t just water; it’s a living soup.
