Bananas are berries, but strawberries aren’t. In botany, a “berry” is a fruit that develops from a single ovary and usually has seeds embedded inside the flesh. Bananas fit that definition perfectly, as do grapes and tomatoes. Strawberries don’t, because their seeds are on the outside and the fleshy part comes from a different part of the flower. The classification sounds goofy, but it shows how everyday language and scientific categories often drift apart. Botany cares about structure and origin, not taste or size.
