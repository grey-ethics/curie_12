There are rivers flowing under the ocean. In some places, very salty water becomes denser than the surrounding seawater and sinks, carving channels along the seafloor. These “submarine rivers” can have banks, bends, waterfalls, and even sand-like dunes made of sediment. One famous example is in the Gulf of Mexico, where brine pools create slow-moving underwater streams. They don’t flow with fresh water, obviously, but the physics is similar: denser fluid moving through a less dense one under gravity.
