There’s a “gravity hole” in the Indian Ocean. South of Sri Lanka, satellites have mapped a region where Earth’s gravitational pull is slightly weaker, causing sea level there to sit about 100 meters lower than the global average. This dip isn’t a literal hole—it comes from unusual mass distribution deep in the mantle. Researchers think it may be linked to ancient tectonic processes and a complex flow of hot, low-density material rising beneath the area. It’s one of the clearest surface clues that Earth’s deep interior is moving and evolving.
