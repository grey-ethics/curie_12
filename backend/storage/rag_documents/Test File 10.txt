Your stomach gets a fresh lining every few days. The inside of the stomach is bathed in strong acid that can dissolve metal, so it needs serious protection. Specialized cells secrete a thick mucus layer, and the surface cells beneath it are replaced rapidly—roughly every 3–5 days. Without this constant renewal, your stomach would start digesting itself. Ulcers can happen when that protective mucus barrier is damaged, letting acid irritate the tissue. So your gut is basically running a nonstop repair crew.
