Trees can “talk” through underground fungal networks. Many forests are connected by mycorrhizal fungi—thin threads that wrap around tree roots and link multiple plants together. Through these networks, trees can transfer nutrients like carbon and nitrogen, and even send chemical signals. For example, when one tree is attacked by insects, it may trigger nearby trees to ramp up defensive chemicals before they’re hit. Scientists sometimes call this the “wood wide web.” It’s not communication like speech, but it’s a real, measurable exchange system that helps forests behave more like cooperative communities than isolated individuals.
