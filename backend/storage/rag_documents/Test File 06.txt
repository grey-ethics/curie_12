Some languages don’t use “left” and “right.” A number of Indigenous languages, such as Guugu Yimithirr in Australia, rely on cardinal directions instead—north, south, east, west—for everyday navigation. Speakers might say “move your cup to the north” instead of “to the left.” This means they constantly track orientation, even indoors or in unfamiliar places. Studies show speakers of these languages often have remarkably strong sense-of-direction skills. It’s a neat example of how language can shape attention and habits, not just communication.
