The first computer programmer was a 19th-century mathematician. Ada Lovelace worked with Charles Babbage on his proposed Analytical Engine, a mechanical general-purpose computer. In 1843 she wrote detailed notes describing how the machine could calculate Bernoulli numbers. Those notes included an algorithm intended for the Engine—widely considered the first published computer program. Even more forward-looking, she argued the machine could handle symbols beyond numbers, hinting at ideas like digital music or graphics. She essentially saw modern computing before the hardware existed.
